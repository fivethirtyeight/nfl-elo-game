## Load the libraries and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dfstools)
if (!require(mvglmmRank)) {
  install.packages("mvglmmRank")
  library(mvglmmRank)
}
nfl_games <- read_csv("../data/nfl_games.csv")
View(nfl_games)
```

## Build the model
```{r}
game_data <- nfl_games %>%
  filter(season >= 2016) %>%
  mutate(
    home = paste(team1, season, sep = "_"),
    away = paste(team2, season, sep = "_"),
    home.response = score1,
    away.response = score2,
    binary.response = result1,
    neutral.site = neutral
  ) %>%
  select(
    home, 
    away, 
    home.response, 
    away.response,
    binary.response,
    neutral.site
  )
View(game_data)
rank_model <- build_model(
  game_data, 
  method = "PB0", 
  first.order = FALSE,
  OT.flag = FALSE
)
